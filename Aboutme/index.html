      <h3> Here's a more in depth description of my personal/professional interests and current pursuits. </h3>
      <h5> Research Interests </h5>
      <p>
        I am interested in the ecology and evolutionary biology of fungi, particularly in the context of their interactions with other organisms. 
        My research focuses on understanding the genetic and ecological factors that shape fungal diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that studying fungi can provide valuable insights into the functioning of ecosystems and the development of sustainable solutions to global challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, hiking, and photographing fungi in their natural habitats. 
        I am also an advocate for science communication and outreach, and I strive to share my passion for fungi with others.
