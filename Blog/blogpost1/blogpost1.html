        <h1>On grieving</h1>

          <p>
            I don’t think I would be ready to grieve for her quite yet but I suppose I will have to be. 
            I supposed I will be when the time comes and I need to. 
            I find grief to be one of the most profound feelings we experience in life and yet, I am lucky enough not to have experienced it all that much. 
            But it is coming. 
            There are people in my life reaching the end of theirs. 
            There is a dog in my life where death is now knocking and I know soon she will answer.
          </p>
          <p>I have a certain disposition to death that it’s a rather good thing. 
            That the fact life is finite is the only possible way that life could be. 
            Even though I believe the end of life is necessary and even good, it still really hurts to watch a loved one experience it. 
            And it should really hurt. 
            It’s good that it feels awful to lose a cherished being. 
            The grief and full on sorrow that hits like a tidal wave and fills the lungs until breath is no longer available is good. 
            It shows that you understand what that being meant to you. 
            You understand in a way that transcends conventional thought. 
            It’s a display of respect and even a strengthening of a connection that is still there even when one of the souls in the relationship has gone missing.
          </p>
          <p>I do not know about this feeling all too much. 
            I just hope that approaching it with this mindset will help me be able to feel it in a healthy way. 
            For when that grief turns to despair, it no longer becomes good. 
            The lost being would understand and even find a sort of profound happiness in the grief a loved one shows them. 
            But when that loved one cannot move on, it would be the lost one who would grieve for them. 
            There must be a time to move on. 
            I will never fully move on from the loss of my dog. 
            She will always hold a spot in my heart that only she can hold. 
            But I will go on living my life without her and she will not always be in my mind. 
            That’s okay. 
            She doesn’t need to be. 
            Our relationship is unique in that she was there during the most influential years of my life. 
            She maybe can’t talk but she taught me a whole lot none the less. 
            She taught me patience and understanding. 
            She taught me that there’s more to life than just looking after oneself. 
            Most of all, she taught me that we weren’t actually that different. 
            That all the beings that share this world are more similar than we as humans care to believe. 
            Even some of her personality must have rubbed off on me somewhere and, even though I may not know it, there are actions that I take and things that I say that come from the Hazel part of me. 
            Again, there’s more at play here than mere conscious thought.</p>
          <p>As Greg Wilson put it, “it comes to us all, don’t it dog.”</p>
          <p>It comes to us all sweet one. You may leave this planet soon but you shall always be with us.</p>
