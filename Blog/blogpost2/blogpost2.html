            The density and vividness of the greenery around me is complete and resounding. 
            It's subtle because, as we walked through it, we didn't pay attention to it. 
            Even though we were identifying trees (the very green I am talking about) we were all too busy with the identification to notice the green.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet now, as I sit here and wonder what to pay attention to, I can't focus on anything else. 
            It is all encompassing. 
            It is so immense and omnipotent that it feels like I am breathing it in with every breath. 
            Every single hue from the spectrum of green is here and it consumes the rest of the world. 
            The soil is totally carpeted and the sky is completely concealed. All for a little bit of light.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to know how it all got here. 
            How each and every species of plant fought, stem and root, for even a square centimeter of light. 
            Why does life try so hard? 
            Even in the harshest conditions, a species will realize a niche and for what?
